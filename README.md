# csci-4220u-w18-uoit-course-project
This is the course project of csci-4220u-w18-uoit: Computer Vision.

**Determine optical flow using python + opencv.**  
Use laptop camera to capture images while moving finger to one direction (up, down, left, right, up-left, etc.) in the air. The program identifies the motion of the finger between every two images to calculate its direction and velocity, then shows the motion simultaneously by moving a ball on the canvas. As shown in the fig. 1.
