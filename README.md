This is the course project of csci-4220u-w18-uoit: Computer Vision.

## [Optical Flow] Gesture recognition using python + opencv. Â 
Use laptop camera to capture images while moving finger to one direction (up, down, left, right, up-left, etc.) in the air. The gesture recognition program identifies the motion of the finger between every two frames to calculate the motion direction and velocity, then shows the motion simultaneously by moving a ball on the canvas. As shown in the following figure.

*Key words:* Optical Flow, Hand and Gesture Detection, YCrCb and HSV Color Space

## Environment  
- Hardware: laptop with camera  
- Software:  
  - OS: Windows 7+  
  - Language: Python 2.7  
  - Libraries: Opencv 2.4, numpy. (You coulde use pip to install required libs)

## Usage
- project.py
- In cmd:
```
$ python project.py [<video_source>]
# default video_source is laptop camera
```
- key operations of program:
  1 - toggle optical flow visualization
  2 - toggle hand contours visualization
  3 - toggle HSV flow visualization

- press 'ESC' to quit
